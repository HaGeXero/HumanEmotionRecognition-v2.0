# HumanEmotionRecognition
An AIML project for a Human emotion recognizer 
We will be using OpenCV for data collection and storing our images. 
After that we will be training an tensorflow lite Model to later deploy it on an android application if possible. 
Dataset used is FER-2013.
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify facial expressions into one of seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
